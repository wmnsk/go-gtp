# v1: GTPv1 in Golang

Package v1 provides simple and painless handling of GTPv1-C and GTPv1-U protocols in pure Golang.

## Getting Started

This package is still under construction. The networking feature is only available for GTPv1-U. GTPv1-C feature would be available in the future.  
See message and ie directory for what you can do with the current implementation. 

### Creating a PDP Context as a client

_NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!_

### Waiting for a PDP Context to be created as a server

_NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!_

### Opening a U-Plane connection

Retrieve `UPlaneConn` first, using `DialUPlane` (for client) or `NewUPlaneConn` (for server). 

#### Client

`DialUPlane` sends Echo Request and returns `UPlaneConn` if it succeeds.
If you don't need Echo, see Server section. As GTP is UDP-based connection, and there are no session management on `UPlaneConn`, the behavior of `Dial` and `ListenAndServe` is not quite different.

```go
uConn, err := v1.Dial(ctx, laddr, raddr)
if err != nil {
	// ...
}
defer uConn.Close()
```

#### Server

Retrieve `UPlaneConn` with `NewUPlaneConn`, and `ListenAndServe` to start listening.

```go
uConn := v1.NewUPlaneConn(laddr)
if err != nil {
	// ...
}
defer uConn.Close()

// This blocks, and returns an error when it's fatal.
if err := uConn.ListenAndServe(ctx); err != nil {
	// ...
}
```

### Manupulating `UPlaneConn`

With `UPlaneConn`, you can add and delete tunnels, and manipulate device directly.

#### Using Linux Kernel GTP-U

Linux Kernel GTP-U is quite performant and easy to handle, but it requires root privilege, and of course it works only on Linux. So it is disabled by default. To get started, enable it first. Note that it cannot be disabled while the program is working.

```go
if err := uConn.EnableKernelGTP("gtp0", v1.roleSGSN); err != nil {
	// ...
}
```

Then, when the bearer information is ready, use `AddTunnel` or `AddTunnelOverride` to add a tunnel.  
The latter one deletes the existing tunnel with the same IP and/or incoming TEID before creating a tunnel,
while the former fails if there's any duplication.

```go
// add a tunnel by giving GTP peer's IP, subscriber's IP,
if err := uConn.AddTunnelOverride(
	net.ParseIP("10.10.10.10"), // GTP peer's IP
	net.ParseIP("1.1.1.1"),     // subscriber's IP
	0x55667788,                 // outgoing TEID
	0x11223344,                 // incoming TEID
); err != nil {
	// ...
}
```

When the tunnel is no longer necessary, use `DelTunnelByITEI` or `DelTunnelByMSAddress` to delete it.  
Or, by `Close`-ing the `UPlaneConn`, all the tunnels associated will the cleared.

```go
// delete a tunnel by giving an incoming TEID.
if err := uConn.DelTunnelByITEI(0x11223344); err != nil {
	// ...
}

// delete a tunnel by giving an IP address assigned to a subscriber.
if err := uConn.DelTunnelByMSAddress(net.ParseIP("1.1.1.1")); err != nil {
	// ...
}
```

The packets NOT forwarded by the Kernel can be handled automatically by giving a handler to `UPlaneConn`.  
Handlers for T-PDU, Echo Request/Response, and Error Indication are registered by default, but you can override them using `AddHandler`.

```go
uConn.AddHandler(message.MsgTypeEchoRequest, func(c v1.Conn, senderAddr net.Addr, msg message.Message) error {
	// do anything you want for Echo Request here.
	// errors returned here are passed to `errCh` that is given to UPlaneConn at the beginning.
	return nil
})
```

If the tunnel with appropriate IP or TEID is not found for a T-PDU packet, Kernel sends it to userland. You can manipulate it with `ReadFromGTP`.

```go
buf := make([]byte, 1500)

// the 3rd returned value is TEID in GTPv1-U Header.
n, raddr, teid, err := uConn.ReadFromGTP(buf)
if err != nil {
	// ...
}

fmt.Printf("%x", buf[:n]) // prints only the payload, no GTP header included.
```

Also, you can send any payload by using `WriteToGTP`. It writes the given payload with GTP header to the specified addr over `UPlaneConn`.

```go
// first return value is the number of bytes written.
if _, err := uConn.WriteToGTP(teid, payload, addr); err != nil {
	// ...
}
```

#### Using userland GTP-U

**Note:** _package v1 does provide the encapsulation/decapsulation and some networking features, but it does NOT provide routing of the decapsulated packets, nor capturing IP layer and above on the specified interface. This is because such kind of operations cannot be done without platform-specific codes._

You can use to `ReadFromGTP` read the packets coming into uConn. This does not work for the packets which are handled by `RelayTo`.

```go
buf := make([]byte, 1500)
n, raddr, teid, err := uConn.ReadFromGTP(buf)
if err != nil {
	// ...
}

fmt.Printf("%x", buf[:n]) // prints the payload encapsulated in the GTP header.
```

Also, you can send any payload by using `WriteToGTP`. It writes the given payload with GTP header to the specified addr over `UPlaneConn`.

```go
// first return value is the number of bytes written.
if _, err := uConn.WriteToGTP(teid, payload, addr); err != nil {
	// ...
}
```

Especially or SGSN/S-GW-ish nodes(=have multiple GTP tunnels and its raison d'Ãªtre is just to forward traffic right to left/left to right) we provide a method to swap TEID and forward T-PDU packets automatically and efficiently.  
By using `RelayTo`, the `UPlaneConn` automatically handles the T-PDU packet in background with the least cost. Note that it's performed on the userland and thus it's not so performant.

```go
// this is the example for S-GW that completed establishing a session and ready to forward U-Plane packets.
s1uConn.RelayTo(s5uConn, s1usgwTEID, s5uBearer.OutgoingTEID, s5uBearer.RemoteAddress)
s5uConn.RelayTo(s1uConn, s5usgwTEID, s1uBearer.OutgoingTEID, s1uBearer.RemoteAddress)
```

### Handling Extension Headers

`AddExtensionHeaders` adds ExtensionHeader(s) to the Header of a Message, set the E flag, and checks if the types given are consistent (error will be returned if not).

```go
msg := message.NewTPDU(0x11223344, []byte{0xde, 0xad, 0xbe, 0xef})
if err := msg.AddExtensionHeaders(
	// We don't support construction of the specific type of an ExtensionHeader.
	// The second parameter should be the serialized bytes of contents.
	message.NewExtensionHeader(
		message.ExtHeaderTypeUDPPort,
		[]byte{0x22, 0xb8},
		message.ExtHeaderTypePDUSessionContainer,
	),
	message.NewExtensionHeader(
		message.ExtHeaderTypePDUSessionContainer,
		[]byte{0x00, 0xc2},
		message.ExtHeaderTypeNoMoreExtensionHeaders,
	),
); err != nil {
	// ...
}
```

ExtensionHeaders decoded or added are stored in `ExtensionHeaders` field in the Header, which can be accessed like this.

```go
// no need to write msg.Header.ExtensionHeaders, as the Header is embedded in messages.
for _, eh := range msg.ExtensionHeaders {
	log.Println(eh.Type)     // ExtensionHeader type has its own Type while it's not actually included in a packet. 
	log.Println(eh.Content)  // We do not support decoding of each type of content yet. Decode them on your own.
	log.Println(eh.NextType) // Don't sort the slice - it ruins the packet, or even cause a panic.
}
```

When you are directly manipulating a Header for some reason, `WithExtensionHeaders` would help you simplify your operation.
Be sure not to call it on a Message, as it returns `*Header`, not a `Message` interface.

```go
header := message.NewHeader(
	0x30, // no need to set E flag here - With... method will do that instead.
	message.MsgTypeEchoRequest,
	0xdeadbeef,
	0x00,
	[]byte{0xde, 0xad, 0xbe, 0xef},
).WithExtensionHeaders(
	message.NewExtensionHeader(
		message.ExtHeaderTypeUDPPort,
		[]byte{0x22, 0xb8},
		message.ExtHeaderTypePDUSessionContainer,
	),
	message.NewExtensionHeader(
		message.ExtHeaderTypePDUSessionContainer,
		[]byte{0x00, 0xc2},
		message.ExtHeaderTypeNoMoreExtensionHeaders,
	),
)
```
